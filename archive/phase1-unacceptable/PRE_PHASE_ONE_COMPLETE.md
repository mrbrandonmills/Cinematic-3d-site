## 🎬 PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

### **Goals Identified:**

1. **Cinema-Quality 3D Web Experience**
   - Scroll-driven narrative using train station metaphor
   - Users "travel" between sections (Home, Store, Gallery, Blog)
   - Museum-quality aesthetics rivaling luxury brands

2. **Performance Targets:**
   - 60 FPS minimum on mid-range devices
   - < 3s load time on 4G
   - < 20MB total asset budget
   - Lighthouse score 90+ target

3. **Visual Quality Standards:**
   - Balanced lighting (not washed out)
   - Smooth subdivision surfaces (not blocky)
   - PBR materials rendering correctly
   - Subtle bloom on emissive lights only
   - Comparable to Pixar/Disney/luxury brand quality

4. **100% Free & Open-Source Stack:**
   - Blender + Python (asset creation)
   - Three.js + GSAP (web rendering)
   - React + TypeScript + Vite (app framework)
   - **Total Cost: $0**

### **Existing Prototypes:**

**Assets:**
- `assets/models/station-home.glb` - Home section train station
- `assets/meta/` - Metadata JSON files and schemas
- `tools/blender-scripts/` - Python automation scripts

**Web Application:**
- `web/src/threeScene.ts` - Three.js scene manager
- `web/src/scrollAnimations.ts` - GSAP scroll animations
- `web/src/sceneConfig.ts` - Section/asset configuration

**Fixes Applied (Pre-Built):**
- ✅ Tone mapping exposure reduced (1.0 → 0.9)
- ✅ Bloom balanced (0.8 → 0.4 strength)
- ✅ Smooth shading enabled in Three.js
- ✅ Lighting matched to style guide
- ✅ RenderDebugger utility created

## ❓ PHASE 1 READINESS QUESTIONS

Before proceeding to Phase 1, here are clarifying questions:

- **Recommended:** YES - ensures latest features, bug fixes, performance improvements
- **Risk:** Potential breaking changes (we'll test thoroughly)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours for upgrades and testing

### **2. Asset Regeneration:**
**Q:** Should we regenerate existing assets with latest fixes (smooth shading, proper normal export)?
- **Recommended:** YES - ensures cinema-quality rendering
- **Reason:** Current `station-home.glb` may not have smooth normals exported correctly
- **Timeline:** 15-30 minutes per asset

### **3. New Sections:**
**Q:** Which sections do you want to prioritize?
- Current: Home, Store (mentioned in docs)
- Potential: Gallery, Blog, About, Contact

### **4. Visual Style:**
**Q:** Are the current style guide colors/theme correct for your brand?
- Current theme: Modern minimalist with warm lighting
- Current colors: Deep blue-gray, warm red, golden orange
- **Confirm:** Does this match your vision, or do you want to adjust?

### **5. Performance Targets:**
**Q:** What devices should we optimize for?
- Mid-range laptops/desktops?
- Mobile devices (iOS/Android)?
- High-end gaming PCs?
- **Please specify:** Target device profile

### **6. Deployment:**
**Q:** Where will this be deployed?
